Special Topics in Digital Humanities: Prototyping

## Course Description
This 6-week online course covers UX prototyping as interactive storytelling in a research-through-design framework. Specifically, students will learn how to develop ideas into tangible, testable, interactive mockups to provide a realistic simulation of current and emerging technology including location-based information, Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, and Interactive Video through a conversational agent, visual overlay, and web animation. We will deep dive into each technology with hands-on experience to understand its history as well as the vision for the future for human well-being.
